Try to look for your current node.js file in `C:\Program Files` and uninstall it.


## Installing the NVM

- Step 2: Find the latest version of nvm-windows and download it.

- Step 3: Locate the installer on your computer and open it. Follow the installation wizard to install it. 

- Step 4: Open up PowerShell or Command Prompt and run `nvm -v` to confirm the installation.

- Step 5: You are good to go! 

:::Note
To use NVM, you need to open PowerShell or Command Prompt as an admin. You can also use Git bash.

## Install Node using NVM

To install the latest version of Node, run:

## Check the list of available versions

Run the following command in your terminal:

You can also install different versions of Node:
```
nvm install node-version-number
nvm install 18.9.1
```

:::Note
Once you install a version of Node, the corresponding version of NPM is installed for you. So you donâ€™t need to install NPM separately.

Run the following command in your terminal:
```
nvm current
```

## Check the list of different versions of Node installed

Run the following command in your terminal:
```
