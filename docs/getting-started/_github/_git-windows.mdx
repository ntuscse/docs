1. Install GIT SCM to your computer, from [here](
https://git-scm.com/download/win
)

2. Check for existing **ssh key pair** in `C:\Users\username\.ssh`.
If you don't have a valid key, generate a new key and add it to your local ssh-agent, as documented [here](
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key
)

3. Add your ssh public key to your **github account**, if you haven't done so already,
as documented [here](
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
)
