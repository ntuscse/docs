<OsTabs
    windows={<GitWindows />}
    macos={<GitMacOS />}
    linux={<GitLinux />}
/>

### Setup mandatory configs

If this is your first time installing Git, you should setup your author details
by running the following command, replacing it with the correct details:
```
git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
git config --global user.email "<Your Email>"

```
git config --global user.name "Jamie Goh"
git config --global user.email "jgoh119@e.ntu.edu.sg"
```

These details will be attached to the changes (commits) you make.
