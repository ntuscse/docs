# AWS Lambda

Let's dive into what AWS Lambda is, how you can use it, why you should use it, and some important points to remember while using it.
The documentation is written from the persepctive of a reader who is completely new to serverless computing and AWS Lambda, and so there are some sections that may
be irrelevant for some readers based on their prior experience with AWS Lambda, so feel free to navigate the sections based on your current knowledge of the service.

## What is AWS Lambda?

In recent years, serverless computing paradigms have become increasingly popular for organizations and companies to develop and deploy their applications.
But, what is serverless computing? Does it mean there are no servers involved? Well, serverless computing still has servers to host application data for deployment,
however it abstracts away the need to manage servers for application developers. How it achieves this is by providing FaaS (Function as a Service) platform whereby 
app developers can simply write cloud native functions in a higher level general purpose language, like Python or Go, to automate tasks of autoscaling or software
patches. 

As opposed to IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) models, where users must prepurchase units of compute like VM's and perform autoscaling and load balancing
themselves, the FaaS model provides an event-driven execution model, where users need not prepurchase or manually scale any units of compute, but rather 
autoscaling is performed based on needs and the user only pays for what they use. Most cloud providers have some form of FaaS service, and Lambda is AWS's FaaS service.

With AWS Lambda, the apps are only launched as needed, as opposed to running a EC2 instance persistently. This provides some serious advantages, one of them being
that the app is only launched when an event (API request, or a client request) triggers the app to run, and the cloud provider will dynamically handle the resource
allocation for the code to serve all requests efficiently. The app will stop running once the requests have been served, and the user will only be charged for the
duration of runtime. Not only does AWS Lambda have clear efficiency and cost benefits, it also abstracts away the processes of operating system maintenance,
security patching, logging, server provisioning, load balancing to the cloud provider, so YOU, the app developer can simply focus on developing your app.

## How does AWS Lambda work?

Now that we've taken a look at some functionalities offered by AWS Lambda, how exactly does it work, and how can you, as an app or API developer leverage the 
functionalities of AWS Lambda?

As mentioned before, AWS Lambda features an event-driven execution model. Specifically, the user would write Lambda functions in a higher level programming language,
like Python or Go which achieve the desired logic. These functions would then be run on lightweight containers whenever an event triggers these functions to run.
The containers are:

* Stateless - any changes made to the container during execution are not saved after container is shut down. They do not store state.
* Ephemeral - they run for a very short time during execution and do not store any state
* Event-Triggered - they run only when the associated event triggers them (we'll look at this in depth later in the doc)
* Fully managed - they are managed by the cloud provider, which means the app developer does not have to create Container Images or monitor the health of the containers.

## How does Lambda link to other AWS services?

If you're using Lambda for serverless computing, chances are you're going to be using services like API Gateway to serve backend API's and AWS Cognito to perform
user authentication. Let's take a look at how AWS Lambda links with API Gateway.

As an API developer, you can create a HTTP endpoint to serve your Lambda function, using API Gateway. Essentially, you write the desired logic of your API as a 
serverless Lambda function, and use API Gateway to direct HTTP requests to the Lambda function, which can serve your web API.

While the implementation of the below tasks will differ based on the API, the general tasks to integrate API Gateway with Lambda are as follows:
1. Add a public endpoint to your Lambda function using API Gateway - This is the endpoint to API Gateway will direct HTTP requests.
2. Proxy integration - this relates to the task of setting up the correct paths and proxies to the public endpoint, and specifying the HTTP method (GET, POST).
3. Define the event format - API Gateway synchronously triggers your Lambda function, thus a JSON event needs to be defined.

On top of these configurations, there are many more options while integrating API Gateway and Lambda, that may be useful for your application/API.

## Why and When to use AWS Lambda?

Now that we've looked at what AWS Lambda is and how you can create serverless routines for your application, it's time to take a look at where and under what use cases
using AWS Lambda will be beneficial.

Specifically, you may want to look into Lambda if your app/API has:

* reptitive scheduled tasks that must occur with a given schedule - these can be easily automated in a similar manner using AWS Lambda as we have demonstarted in the
example above.

* asynchronous requests - if your app or API services or calls requests asynchronously, then AWS Lambda functions can be used to trigger a certain routine based 
on completion of some event.

* Stateless - if your app is stateless, then you might consider using entirely Lambda to service your app.

* Data aggregation - if your application is performing some data aggregation over a continuous stream of data, then AWS Lambda can be used to asynchronously
aggregate data by a defined logic based on an input data stream from Amazon S3, or other apps/databases.

While AWS Lambda and serverless computing provide a ton of cool features, nonetheless, Lambda is not the answer for all your needs. For example, larger apps that require
state and do not have a defined schedule of execution but feature wide ranging features and modules might be better served using microservices and container
orchestration.
