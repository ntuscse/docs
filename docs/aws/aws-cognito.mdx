# AWS Cognito

Amazon Cognito provides Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. 
Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple. The two main components of 
Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. 
Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other Amazon services. You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.

## User pools

A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With user pools, users can sign into web and mobile apps through Amazon Cognito and other third party apps like 
Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple.

User pools provide the following services:
1. Sign up and sign in services
2. Customizable Web UI for user authentication
3. User directory management and user profiles
4. Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda.

## Identity pools

With identity pools, user can temporarily gain access to AWS services associated with your organization Like Amazon S3 and AMazon DynamoDB. For your use case, these
users will be internal developers who will require access to certain services to develop their apps. For more information about your access span, contact your 
system administrator.

Amazon Cognito is a very efficient, secure, and easy to use authentication tool which is very commonly paired with AWS Lambda and API Gateway to build a serverless
runtime environment to deliver apps.
