### Step 2. Add Peotry to your `PATH`

The installer creates a `poetry` wrapper in `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts` on Windows.

If this directory is not present in your `$PATH`, you can add it in order to invoke Poetry as `poetry`.

### Step 3. Use Poetry

Once Poetry is installed and in your $PATH, you can execute the following

```bash
poetry --version
```
