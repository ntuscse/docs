### Step 1. Install Peotry

Run the following with bash

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Step 2. Add Peotry to your `PATH`

The installer creates a `poetry` wrapper in

- `$HOME/.local/bin` on Unix
- `$POETRY_HOME/bin` if `$POETRY_HOME` is set.

If this directory is not present in your `$PATH`, you can add it in order to invoke Poetry as `poetry`.

### Step 3. Use Poetry

Once Poetry is installed and in your $PATH, you can execute the following

```bash
poetry --version
```
