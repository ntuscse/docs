# Git Quickstart

This page contains [Git][git-link] commands that may be useful
during development. Examples have been provided where the command to be
executed is prefixed with `$` and the sample output are not.

This document assumes that you have setup Git properly as per [this
page](../getting-started/github). You should setup your Git before continuing.

Please refer to the [documentation for Git][git-doc] for a
deeper understanding in Git.

## Initialization/Cloning

To initialize a new repository (project managed by Git), use [`git init`][git-init].
To clone an existing repository, use [`git clone`][git-clone].

You should only initialize OR clone a repository.

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/example/.git/
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ntuscse/docs
Cloning into 'docs'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 239, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (239/239), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (174/174), done.
remote: Total 239 (delta 86), reused 192 (delta 54), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (239/239), 1.41 MiB | 1.10 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (86/86), done.
```

## Reviewing Status

You may check the status of your current repository with [`git status`][git-status].

```
$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

## Staging/Unstaging Files

Files are not automagically tracked by Git, Git needs to be told that it should
track the current version. To do so, use [`git add`][git-add] to __stage__ the
file.

You may wish to specify directories instead of files (adding every file
recursively). The current directory (`.`) is particularly helpful.

```
$ git add .
$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   ExampleTestFile.txt
```

To unstage files (tell Git to forget about the current version that you added),
use [`git rm --cached <file>`][git-rm] as suggested by the output provided in
[`git status`][git-status].

:::caution
Note that `--cached` tells Git to only remove the cached version and not the
file itself! Failing to specify `--cached` will cause the file to be deleted as
well.
:::

```
$ git rm --cached ExampleTestFile.txt
rm 'ExampleTestFile.txt'

$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	ExampleTestFile.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

You may specify multiple files at once for both commands by separating them
with spaces.
```
$ git add a.txt b.txt
$ git rm --cached a.txt b.txt
rm 'a.txt'
rm 'b.txt'
```

## Creating Commits

To add the current snapshot you crafted with [`git add`][git-add] into the
actual history, use [`git commit`][git-commit].

Please use `-m` to specify the commit message. The first `-m` will specify the
title of the commit and the second `-m` will specify the body of the commit.

```
$ git commit -m "docs: Fix typo in Example docs" -m "Example should be spelled with a single e rather than two es.
dquote>
dquote>[SCSE-24]"
[main 4faee54] docs: Fix typo in Example docs
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Note that in this example, `dquote>` should not be typed in. It simply means
that the text after is still part of the double quotes.

For an idea of what to write, please refer to our
[conventions](naming-convention#commit-messages) document.

### Fixing Mistakes

No one gets their code correct every single time and mistakes happen. If you
messed up the content of a commit (the changes you made) or the title/message,
you can just re-create the commit with the `--amend` flag!

This will replace the latest commit with the new one that hopefully is fine
this time. ;)

```
$ git commit --amend -m "docs: Fix typo in Example docs" -m "Example should be spelled with a single e rather than two es.
dquote>
dquote>[SCSE-24]"
[main f253a79] docs: Fix typo in Example docs
 Date: Thu Oct 13 23:39:33 2022 +0800
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

:::caution
Note that by doing this, you are recreating history!
NEVER ever re-create history (amend commits) that you have already pushed (made
public) unless you are sure that you are the only person that worked on it.

Modifying your own PR branch is generally considered OK but modifying `main` is
not.
:::

## Branching

You should definitely create a branch for what you are working on before you
start working on your super cool feature.

To quote [Pro Git Chapter 3][pro-git-chap-3], branching means you diverge from
the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with
that main line.

The [`git switch`][git-switch] command has been added in Git v2.23 (released
2020 Jan) to help make the process simpler. `-c` will create a branch with the
specified name while not providing it will simply switch you over to that
branch.

Note that [`git switch`][git-switch] is still considered experimental and its
syntax and/or behaviour may change. While this is unlikely, this command should
not be used for scripting. For that, you may want to check out the commands
[`git checkout`][git-checkout] and [`git branch`][git-branch].

```
$ git switch -c docs/SCSE-24
Switched to a new branch 'docs/SCSE-24'

$ git switch main
Switched to branch main

$ git switch -c docs/SCSE-24
fatal: a branch named 'docs/SCSE-24' already exists
```

## Pulling/Pushing Your Changes

You've finally finished that super cool feature you worked on! Now you just
need to **push** it to GitHub where we host our code for everyone to see it!

However, you should definitely check that your changes are compatible with all
the new changes other people have finished while you were working on your
project.

To do so, apply your changes on top of the current code on GitHub with [`git
pull --rebase`][git-pull].

```
$ git pull --rebase origin main
remote: Enumerating objects: 204, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (204/204), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (112/112), done.
remote: Total 204 (delta 104), reused 181 (delta 91), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (204/204), 72.83 KiB | 298.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (104/104), completed with 25 local objects.
From github.com/ntuscse/docs
[More output omitted]
```

After checking your code still works or after you finish fixing it, it's time
to show it to everyone by pushing it to GitHub with [`git push`][git-push]!

```
$ git push
Total 204 (delta 104), reused 181 (delta 91), pack-reused 0
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'docs/SCSE-24' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/ntuscse/docs/pull/new/docs/SCSE-24
remote:
To github.com/ntuscse/docs
 * [new branch]      docs/SCSE-24 -> docs/SCSE-24
```

It is possible to fix the naming of your branches while you are pushing. For
example, if you accidentally worked on the `main` branch locally and wish to
push your changes to GitHub as `docs/SCSE-24`, you can still specify what the
name at GitHub should be while pushing.

```
$ git push origin main:docs/SCSE-24
Total 204 (delta 104), reused 181 (delta 91), pack-reused 0
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'docs/SCSE-24' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/ntuscse/docs/pull/new/docs/SCSE-24
remote:
To github.com/ntuscse/docs
 * [new branch]      main -> docs/SCSE-24
```

## What Next?

This document is currently work in progress! If there is anything you are
unclear about, ask about them in our Discord and we will be using those valuable
feedbacks to improve this page.

Git is just a tool to help manage different versions of code as we collaborate
and is nothing if we don't use it so start familiarizing yourself with it! You
may wish to do so by [creating your own GitHub repository][create-github-repo]
and playing around with it.

You might want to check out the [naming conventions](naming-convention) we have
written to help keep everything tidy.

## Appendix A: Fixing History

So you did not heed my advice in [mistake fixing](#fixing-mistakes) and
recreated history that has already been pushed. Now, GitHub is angry at you
whenever you try to push.

```
$ git push
To github.com/ntuscse/docs
 ! [rejected]        docs/SCSE-24 -> docs/SCSE-24 (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com/ntuscse/docs'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

You have three options, all of them pretty nuclear but that is the state we are
in.

#### Option 1: Force push (softer version)

Perhaps you were just pushing to the branch of your PR and it's actually fine
to override it.

:::caution
Before continuing, make sure that you are pushing to the branch of your own
task (PR) and not someone else's branch. You can check this by reading the
right side of the arrow in the error message.
:::

In that case, you can run `git push` with `--force-with-lease`. This will tell
GitHub that you really do intend to override the changes on GitHub.

#### Option 2: Force push (harder version)

Well, that didn't work. GitHub is complaining that the version you have saved
locally is different from the version on GitHub (a sign that someone else has
worked on it).

:::danger
At this point, you should make ***extra*** sure that you are not overriding
someone else's work. If there is even a hint of doubt, ask someone to double
check for you.

This is **NOT** a command you should use typically.
:::

If you are absolutely sure that you want to proceed regardless, run `git push`
with `--force` or `-f`. This tells GitHub to ignore the changes on remote
completely and that your changes are the right ones. If you have sufficient
permissions (which you should have for your own PR branch), this will succeed.

#### Option 3: Hard reset

This approach is straightforward. It resets **all** the changes you have back
to the state that your computer thinks is on GitHub.

:::caution
This will rollback all the changes to fit the pushed version.
:::

To do so, use [`git reset --hard`][git-reset].

```
$ git reset --hard origin/docs/SCSE-24
HEAD is now at f253a79 docs: Fix typo in Example docs
